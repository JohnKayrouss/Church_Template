			"The mission of our church is to reach out, serve, support, and enhance the lives of immigrants and refugees from the Middle East; to lead them to accept Jesus Christ Lord and Saviour and to become members of the church of Jesus Christ; and to preach the gospel in the entire world, making disciples, and feeding the flock. We strive to provide spiritual guidance, practical assistance, and a welcoming community for those in need. (Matthew 28:19-20; James 1:27) Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.",

		itemName: "Our Vision",
		itemContent:
			"The vision of the Church is to recognize that freely giving, sharing, and helping others in Godly love will in turn, further empower others to do the same. We desire to impact and enrich the lives of new immigrants for Christ through evangelism, spiritual care, and practical ministry. We also seek to become a multi-cultural, multi-lingual, and multi-generational church that reaches out to immigrants from the Middle East living in metropolitan Richmond, VA. Believing that God has put all things under the Lordship of Jesus, and as He is the Head of the Church, we are building a church family to proclaim the Gospel for the salvation of all. (1 John 4:11-12; Ephesians 4:11-13) Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:",

		itemName: "Our Primary Goals",
		itemContent:
			"Our primary goals are diverse yet interconnected. We aim to reach out to Middle Eastern immigrants living in the Richmond area and invite them to participate in Christian worship and fellowship. Additionally, we strive to assist new immigrants from the Middle East in understanding and adjusting to American culture through our ongoing practical ministry program. We are dedicated to training and equipping officers and leaders to serve the church and carry out the ministry and vision of the church. Providing programs and activities for immigrant children and youth is another key goal, aiming to lead them to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and integrate them into the life and ministry of the local church. (Matthew 25:35-36; 2 Timothy 2:2) For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.",

		itemName: "Our Core Values",
		itemContent:
			"At the heart of our church are our core values, which guide everything we do. These values include love, compassion, unity, and service. We believe in loving one another as Christ loved us, showing compassion to those who are suffering, fostering unity within our diverse community, and serving others selflessly. These values shape our interactions, decisions, and priorities as we seek to fulfill God's purpose for our church and our lives. (John 13:34-35; Philippians 2:3-4) A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.",
